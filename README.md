A fun and interactive betting game for wedding guests to predict the answers to questions throughout your wedding day.

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.7+** installed on your computer/tablet
- **Google Pixel Tablet** (or any Android/Windows tablet)
- **WiFi** available at your venue
- **Port 5000** available on your device

## Installation

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Open a terminal in the `wedding-game` directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- **Flask** - Web framework
- **qrcode** - QR code generation
- **Pillow** - Image processing
- **python-dotenv** - Environment configuration

### 2. Prepare Guest List

Edit `data/guests.csv` and replace the sample names with your actual 90 guests:

```csv
first_name,last_name
John,Smith
Jane,Doe
Robert,Johnson
...
```

**Important**: Use exactly the spelling your guests expect (first name and last name in separate columns).

### 3. Configure Questions

Edit `config.py` and update the `QUESTIONS` list (currently 4 questions — ceremony start, speech duration, thank-you count, cake cutting):

```python
QUESTIONS = [
    {
        "text": "Your question here?",
        "short_label": "Short Label",
        "type": "number",  # or "time"
        "unit": "minutes",
        "order": 1,
        "min": 0,
        "max": 120
    },
    # ... more questions
]
```

### 4. Set Admin Password (Optional but Recommended)

Edit `config.py` and change the `ADMIN_PASSWORD`:

```python
ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'YourSecurePassword'
```

## Running the Application

### On Your Computer (Testing)

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:5000`

### On Wedding Day (Tablet)

1. **Find tablet's IP address**:
   - Windows: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`
   - Look for IPv4 Address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

2. **Update `config.py`** with the tablet's IP:
   ```python
   BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.1.100:5000'
   ```

3. **Double-click `start.bat`** (Windows) or run `python app.py`

4. **Access from guests' phones**:
   - Guests visit: `http://192.168.1.100:5000` (or scan QR code in corner)

5. **Admin interface** (groomsman):
   - Visit: `http://192.168.1.100:5000/admin` from their phone
   - Login with your admin password
   - Update actual answers as events happen
   - Check leaderboard in real-time

## How It Works

### Guest Flow

1. **Home Screen**: Tap "Start"
2. **Search**: Find your name by typing
3. **Questions**: Answer 4 questions on a 2x2 grid (all visible at once)
   - Adjust sliders with nudge buttons for fine control
   - Toggle to "one at a time" mode if preferred
4. **Submit**: Tap "Submit Answers" → inline confirmation modal shows chosen values
5. **QR Code**: Scan with phone to save your answers
6. **Leaderboard**: Check your ranking (once answers are revealed)

### Admin Flow

1. Navigate to: `http://[tablet-ip]:5000/admin`
2. Login with admin password
3. **Dashboard**: Update actual answers as events happen
4. **Leaderboard**: View real-time rankings
5. **Responses**: Detailed view of all guest answers per question

## Scoring System

**Lower score = Better (Closer to actual answer)**

Score = Average Percentage Error

For each question:
- Error = |Your Guess - Actual Answer| / Actual Answer × 100%
- Final Score = Average of all question errors

Example:
- Question 1: Your guess 30, Actual 25 → Error = 20%
- Question 2: Your guess 150, Actual 100 → Error = 50%
- Final Score = (20% + 50%) / 2 = 35%

## Customization

### Questions

All questions can be customized in `config.py`. Options:

```python
{
    "text": "Question text here?",
    "short_label": "Short Label",  # Shown on grid cards
    "type": "number" or "time",
    "unit": "unit name (minutes, mentions, etc)",
    "order": 1-4 (display order),
    "min": 0,           # Min slider value (or "HH:MM" for time)
    "max": 1000         # Max slider value (or "HH:MM" for time)
}
```

### Colors & Styling

Edit `static/css/style.css` CSS variables at `:root` to customize:
- Primary (Dark Teal): `#348686`
- Accent (Confetti Dark): `#540f3b`
- Dark mode is the default; light mode via `prefers-color-scheme: light`

### Admin Password

Edit `config.py`:
```python
ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'YourNewPassword'
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors

**Solution**: Reinstall dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database file not created

**Solution**: First run initializes database automatically. If issues persist:
```bash
python database.py
```

### Tablet can't access the game

**Solution**:
1. Make sure tablet and groomsman's phone are on same WiFi
2. Check tablet IP with `ipconfig`
3. Update `BASE_URL` in `config.py`
4. Restart with `python app.py`

### Guest not in list

**Options**:
1. Re-spell their name in the search (e.g., "Jon" instead of "John")
2. Add them to `data/guests.csv` before event
3. Manual entry feature (coming soon)

### QR codes don't scan

**Solution**:
1. Increase brightness on tablet
2. Try different phones to test
3. Ensure `BASE_URL` in config matches tablet IP

### Admin password forgotten

**Solution**:
1. Edit `config.py`
2. Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to new value
3. Restart server with `python app.py`

## Backup & Recovery

### Automated Backups

Database backups are created in `data/backups/` every 15 minutes during operation.

### Manual Export

From admin dashboard, use "Export Data" to download CSV of all responses.

### Restore from Backup

Copy backup file from `data/backups/` to `data/wedding.db`:
```bash
copy data/backups/wedding_backup_[timestamp].db data/wedding.db
```
